# Matching social events with your interest

## Synopsis
  The algorithm abstracts top 10 tags related to a post, or a key word, from TUMBLER. It searches relevant MEETUP event using these 10 tags, and then provides 5 upcomming events sorted by the relevance. It can be utilized to broaden one's interest by analyzing others' interest.

## Motivation
  I was curious about what other people who share similar interest with me usually do. I hypothesized that a tag used at a social media shows us the one's interests and tags are somewhat related each other.
