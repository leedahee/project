# Matching social event with your interest

## Synopsis
  "Tag" shows us the one's interests. The algorithm abstracts top 10 tags related to posts from Tumbler, searches these tags at Meetup, and then provides top 5 upcomming events sorted by the relevance. It can be utilized to broaden one's interest by analyzing  and suggest interesting activities accordingly.
